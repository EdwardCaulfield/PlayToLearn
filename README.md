# PlayToLearn
Play To Learn is a real-time sight reading trainer for iOS and Android written in C# using Visual Studio.  Athough the App should work on any Android or iOS device, many Android devices donÂ´t have sufficient processing power to work well and the screens on most phones are too small to be realistically usable.  Because of this, the App is best experienced on an iPad of any generation.  I have not yet experimented with Android tablets.

The App has a collection of MIDI files that can be read to display a song.  It listens to the user as they play the displayed song 
and indicates which notes the user plays and where.

Although designed to be extensible, the only instrument currently supported is a six string guitare.

The App defaults to English, however also supports German and Chinese.
